# Open Trail Map

Open Trail Map is a web application to view trails, bike paths and dirt roads in the [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) database.  It allows a user to search for any location in the world and then select a trail to view distances, elevation stats and an elevation profile.

## Example
[OpenTrails](http://michaelskaug.com/projects/OpenTrailMap/)

## Usage
The entry point is ```index.html```.  To run the app, start a web server in this repository's directory with, for example:
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
and then navigate to ```http://localhost:8000/#``` in a web browser

### Dependencies
Open Trail Map is built on Leaflet in addition to some plugins and libraries:
- [Leaflet 0.7.7](http://leafletjs.com/download.html)
- [leaflet-search 1.8.4](https://github.com/stefanocudini/leaflet-search)
- [leaflet-legend 1.0.0](https://github.com/mikeskaug/Leaflet.Legend)
- [bootstrap 3.3.5](http://getbootstrap.com)
- [font-awesome 4.4.0](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)
- [osmtogeojson 2.2.5](https://github.com/tyrasd/osmtogeojson)

These can be installed individually (if you do this, make sure that index.html points to the correct location for the files) or in one step with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com):
```js
npm install
```

The following are also required, but they are loaded via a CDN, so they don't need to be installed separately:
- [d3 3.5.6](http://d3js.org)
- [jquery 1.11.3](http://jquery.com)


Open Trail Map also uses [Leaflet.Elevation](https://github.com/MrMufflon/Leaflet.Elevation) to display the elevation profiles, but the (modified) code comes packaged with this project.

### Map Components
Open Trail Map interacts with several service providers, some of which require a user account and a security key.
#####Map tiles
Leaflet can [load map imagery](http://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start.html) from many locations with the ```L.tilelayer()``` command.  For example, I used [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com):
```js
L.tileLayer('https://api.tiles.mapbox.com/v4/{id}/{z}/{x}/{y}.png?access_token={accessToken}', {
	attribution: 'Map data &copy; <a href="http://openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">CC-BY-SA</a>, Imagery &copy <a href="http://mapbox.com">Mapbox</a>',
	maxZoom: 18,
	id:'YOUR_ID',
	accessToken: 'YOUR_TOKEN'
    }).addTo(map);
```

#####Google Maps API
Open Trail Map also uses the [Google Maps Javascript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/) to access geocoding and elevation data.  This service requires an account and is loaded in the html:
```html
<script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_KEY&libraries=geometry"></script>
```

### To Do
The most significant issue now is that trail data is not loaded dynamically as the user pans and zooms the map, as a user might expect.  If a user wants to view trails in a new location, she must search for the new location and then trail data is loaded for a limited region around that point.  The reason for this is the significant time required to query and load data from the OpenStreetMap API.  The best solution would probably be to build a new database specifically designed for this purpose, or try caching data and limiting the pan and zoom.
